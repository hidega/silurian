IT-725 - Integration test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Overview

The main objective is to establish an automated test suite for the MongoDB
backed message bus component.  The clients run in dedicated containers.  The
browser frontend client communicates with the middleware through websocket.
The proxy server handles and secures both HTTP and websocket traffic.  The
time series database package acts as a system logger service.  The MongoDb
server is a custom built server of which a single instance is running.  On the
clientside, the Bootstrap 4 framework plus JQuery is used and examined.

The following packages are involved and tested:
  @silurian/messagebus
  @silurian/counters
  @silurian/tsdb
  @silurian/filesrv 
  @permian/proxy
  @permian/websocket

* Containers

(no container) : HTTP hello world

on the dmz network:

lagrange::nodebase
  HTTPS proxy, exposed to the outside world, WSS sserver connected to the bus.
  it725-proxy
  it725-wss

euler::nodebase
  system logger KVPS connected to mongodb
  it725-syslog

gauss::mongodb
  mongodb with database within the container, plus ntp daemon

cauchy::nodebase
  business middleware: counters connected to mongodb and fileserver
  it725-counters : operates hit counters
  it725-filesrv : webclient provider
  it725-eventsources : generates events for the web client via websocket
                       and for local handlers
  it725-eventhandlers : handles and counts incoming events

dedekind::nodebase
  network maintenance and troubleshooting tools
